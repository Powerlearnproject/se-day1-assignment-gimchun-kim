# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is procces of designing ,testing and maintaining software
provides a structured aproach to develop reliable and scalable software solutions that meet needs of users
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
era description
mastering procces ensure correctness
List and briefly explan deployment and maintenance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is a linear ,sequencial project where each phase must be fully complete before moving to the next while agile methodology is a flexible approach that emphasize continous adaptation and collaboration allowing changes to progress

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
design,code,test,and maintain software applications.
ensuring services meet quality standards.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

provides a comprehensinive suite of tools wthin a single interface
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
rapid tecnologcal change, changing requirements

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit ,verifies the behavior of isolated code units.integraton verifies how different parts of software system work together.
system ,evaluates a software system functonality as a whole
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
isthe procces of writing instructions to get thne best results from an AI model
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
benefits of exercise ,provides clear instructions , specific  context and rescues ambiguity, leading to more accurate responses from AI model
